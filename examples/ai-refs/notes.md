## Ideas & Thoughts

### Design Inspiration
- Check out https://brittanychiang.com/ for clean portfolio layout
- Like the minimal aesthetic of https://caferati.me/
- Color scheme: Dark mode with accent color (maybe teal or purple?)

### Content Planning
Need to write:
- Short bio (2-3 paragraphs)
- Project descriptions for 5 main projects
- Skills/technologies list

### Future Enhancements
- Add blog section (phase 2)
- Portfolio filtering by technology
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Animations on scroll
- Case studies for major projects

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **CSS Layout:** Leaning toward CSS Grid for main layout, Flexbox for smaller components. Grid seems cleaner for this use case.

2. **Blog:** Definitely want this eventually, but not blocking initial launch. Can add in v2 with markdown + static site generator maybe?

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Need a professional online presence to showcase my work and allow potential clients to contact me. Current situation: no website, relying on LinkedIn which isn't customizable.

---

## 2. SOLUTION OVERVIEW

Simple, clean portfolio website with landing page showcasing projects and a contact form. Static site for fast loading and easy deployment.

## 3. PROJECTS

### Portfolio Site

- **Database:** Not applicable
- **Deployment:** Netlify
- **Other:** Form handling via Netlify Forms

**Dependencies:**

---

## 4. ARCHITECTURE

Single-page static website with multiple sections (hero, about, projects, contact).

**Data Flow:**

```

## 5. TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS

### Static Site Approach
**Choice:** Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)  
**Reason:** Simple site doesn't need React/Vue complexity. Faster load times, easier maintenance.  
**Decided:** 2025-10-22 14:00 UTC

### Hosting Platform
**Choice:** Netlify  
**Reason:** Free tier sufficient, auto-deploy from Git, includes form handling  
**Decided:** 2025-10-22 14:00 UTC  
**Alternatives Considered:** GitHub Pages (no form handling), Vercel (overkill for static site)

# Flight Plan Awareness

## Context Loading

On first interaction in this project:

1. **Read Solution PRD:**
   - Path: `../../../solution-prd-v1.md`
   - Purpose: Understand overall solution and this project's role

2. **Read Project Progress:**
   - Path: `./.flight-plan/current.md`
   - Purpose: Know current phase, tasks, blockers

3. **Read Requirements (WHAT):**
   - Path: `./.flight-plan/requirements.md`
   - Purpose: Understand what to build (tech-agnostic)

4. **Read Implementation (HOW):**
   - Path: `./.flight-plan/implementation.md`
   - Purpose: Know technology stack and architecture

5. **Check Coordination:**
   - Path: `../../../ai-refs/solution-overview.md`
   - Purpose: See cross-project status and dependencies

## During Work

### Track Progress
- Update `.flight-plan/current.md` when completing tasks
- Check off completed items
- Add new blockers if encountered
- Note when moving to next phase

### Log Successful Patterns
- Save working prompts to `.flight-plan/prompts/successful.md`
- Note what worked well for future reference

### Document Decisions
- Major technical decisions → `.flight-plan/decisions/[title].md`
- Include: what, why, alternatives, date

### Reference Materials
- Check `docs/third-party/` for API specs
- Check `docs/snippets/` for code examples
- Check `docs/research/` for background

---

## Requirements vs Implementation

**When working on features:**
1. Check `requirements.md` first (what user needs)
2. Then check `implementation.md` (how to build it)
3. Ensure code matches requirements
4. Update both files if scope changes

**When changing technology:**
1. Update `implementation.md` only
2. Requirements stay the same (WHAT doesn't change)
3. Log decision in `.flight-plan/decisions/`

---

## Cross-Project Coordination

### Before Making Breaking Changes
1. Check `implementation.md` for internal dependencies
2. Review `../../../ai-refs/solution-overview.md`
3. Identify affected projects
4. Update their specs if needed

### When Blocked by Another Project
1. Note in `.flight-plan/current.md` blockers
2. Update `solution-overview.md` with dependency
3. Consider stub/mock until unblocked

## Flight Plan Commands

This project supports Flight Plan commands:

- `flight-plan status` - Show progress
- `flight-plan sync` - Sync with latest PRD
- `flight-plan evaluate` - Check requirements vs code
- `flight-plan review` - List blockers and TODOs
- `flight-plan note` - Add log entry
- `flight-plan deps` - Show dependencies

See `../../../FLIGHT-PLAN-COMMANDS.md` for details.

## Code Organization

**Expected Structure:**
```
portfolio-site/
├── .flight-plan/           # Progress tracking (don't modify directly)
├── docs/                   # Reference materials
├── src/                    # Source code (index.html, styles.css, script.js)
└── README.md              # Project overview
```

---

## Safety Rules

⚠️ **Never modify:**
- `.flight-plan/` files without explicit user request
- Other projects' directories
- `solution-prd-v*.md` files

✅ **Always:**
- Read context files before making assumptions
- Update progress when completing tasks
- Log important decisions
- Check for dependencies before breaking changes

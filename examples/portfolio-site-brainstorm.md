# Portfolio Website - Raw Brainstorm

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Context:** Need to create online presence

## My Thinking (Unstructured)

Need a website to show my work. Currently just have LinkedIn but it's not really mine, you know? Can't customize it the way I want.

Thinking just a simple portfolio site. Landing page with my info, show off some projects I've done, and a way for people to contact me.

Don't need anything fancy. Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Keep it simple. No frameworks - they're overkill for something this basic. Plus faster load times without all that framework overhead.

Deploy on Netlify probably. Free tier works fine for my needs. Plus they have that form handling built in so I don't need a backend just for a contact form. That's nice.

Need to figure out if I should include a blog section now or add that later. Probably later? Just want to get the core stuff up first.

Also not sure if I should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the layout. Both work fine, just need to pick one.

Timeline: should be able to knock this out in a day or two tops. It's not complex.

Custom domain would be nice but can start with the Netlify subdomain and add custom later.

## Key Points
- Portfolio + contact form
- Static site (HTML/CSS/JS)
- No framework needed
- Netlify hosting
- Blog maybe later
- 1-2 days to build

Based on our conversation, here's a complete summary of the Task Manager project we've designed:

## Project Overview

We're building a simple task manager web application as a proof-of-concept. This is a learning project to explore modern web development practices with a minimal but realistic feature set. Everything will run locally - no cloud deployment or production infrastructure needed.

## Architecture

The solution consists of two separate projects that communicate via REST API:

**Frontend (task-manager-ui):**
- React single-page application
- Vite as the build tool (modern, fast HMR)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (responsive design)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect)
- Runs on localhost:5173

**Backend (task-manager-api):**
- Node.js with Express framework
- In-memory data store (JavaScript array - no database needed)
- CORS middleware enabled for cross-origin requests
- RESTful API endpoints
- Runs on localhost:3001

The frontend depends on the backend's API contract, so we'll need to document the API endpoints clearly.

## Core Features

We're keeping the feature set minimal to focus on learning the fundamentals:

1. **View Tasks** - Display a list of all tasks
2. **Add Task** - Create a new task with a title
3. **Toggle Completion** - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
4. **Delete Task** - Remove tasks from the list

No user authentication, no categories, no tags - just the essential CRUD operations.

## API Design

Standard REST endpoints:

- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task (requires title in body)
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update a task (mainly for toggling completed status)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete a task

## Data Model

Each task has these properties:
- `id` - Unique identifier (string or number)
- `title` - Task description (required, max 200 characters)
- `completed` - Boolean flag for completion status
- `createdAt` - Timestamp of when the task was created

## Validation & Error Handling

**Backend validation:**
- Task title is required and cannot be empty
- Task title maximum length: 200 characters
- Valid task ID required for updates/deletes
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)

**Frontend validation:**
- Prevent submission of empty tasks
- Display inline error messages (no toast libraries)
- Show loading spinners during API operations

## Initial State

The backend will start with 3 sample tasks pre-populated, so users see data immediately when they load the application.

## Technology Choices & Rationale

**Why in-memory storage instead of a database?**
This is a proof-of-concept focused on learning the frontend/backend interaction patterns. An in-memory store keeps setup simple - no database installation, no schema migrations, no connection configuration. We can focus on the API design and React development without infrastructure overhead.

**Why Vite instead of Create React App?**
Vite offers significantly faster development experience with instant Hot Module Replacement, smaller bundle sizes, and represents current industry best practices. It's become the de facto standard for new React projects.

**Why Tailwind CSS?**
Tailwind's utility-first approach allows rapid prototyping without thinking about CSS architecture or naming conventions. It makes responsive design straightforward and is widely adopted in modern web development.

**Why separate frontend and backend projects?**
This mirrors real-world architectures where frontend and backend are separate deployable units. It forces us to think about API contracts, CORS configuration, and how the two pieces communicate. Even though both run locally, keeping them separate is good practice and closer to how production systems work.

**Why REST instead of GraphQL?**
REST is simpler, more familiar to most developers, and perfectly suited for basic CRUD operations. There's no need for GraphQL's schema complexity in this small project.

## Development Setup

This is a local-only POC with no deployment infrastructure. To run:
- `npm run dev` in the frontend (starts Vite dev server on :5173)
- `npm start` in the backend (starts Express server on :3001)

The backend CORS configuration will explicitly allow requests from localhost:5173.

Both servers need to run simultaneously during development.

## Success Criteria

The project is complete when:

**Planning Complete:**
- Requirements documented clearly
- API contract fully specified
- All technology decisions finalized
- Project structure set up

**Initial Validation:**
- Frontend displays hardcoded tasks successfully
- Backend GET endpoint returns mock data
- Frontend successfully calls backend API

**Full Implementation:**
- All CRUD operations working end-to-end
- Form validation working on frontend and backend
- Error handling implemented and tested
- Loading states visible during API calls
- Responsive design working on mobile and desktop
- Code is clean and organized

**Ready to Use:**
- Both projects running without errors locally
- README files contain clear setup instructions
- Someone new can clone and run the project easily

## Next Steps

Once we have this working, we could extend it with:
- Task categories or tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Task priority levels
- Search and filter functionality
- Persistent storage (SQLite or JSON file)

But for the initial POC, we're keeping scope tight to nail the fundamentals: a clean React UI, a solid API design, and proper frontend/backend communication. The simple scope means we can build it quickly while still learning the key patterns.

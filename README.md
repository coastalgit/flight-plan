# Flight Plan Solution System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Production Ready

A structured approach for initializing multi-project solutions using AI assistance and the Flight Plan methodology.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

A 3-phase workflow for taking messy brainstorms and turning them into organized, AI-ready project structures.

**Phase 1:** Brainstorm freely (any AI, any tool)  
**Phase 2:** Format with Brief Builder → `solution-prd-v1.md`  
**Phase 3:** Generate structure with Generator → Complete project setup

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Brainstorm Your Solution

Use any AI (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) to explore ideas freely:
- What problem you're solving
- Project components needed
- Technology choices
- Architecture ideas

**No structure required** - just capture your thinking.

### 2. Format into PRD

Give any AI your brainstorm notes + `BRIEF-BUILDER-v1.0.md`:

```
Use BRIEF-BUILDER-v1.0.md to format my brainstorm.

Here are my notes:
[paste your brainstorm]
```

AI generates: `solution-prd-v1.md` (structured, versioned, with TODOs)

### 3. Generate Project Structure

Drop `solution-prd-v1.md` into this directory, then:

**In Cursor:**
```
Open flight-plan-solution/ in Cursor
Say: "Read GENERATOR.md and create the project structure"
```

**Or CLI:**
```
cd flight-plan-solution/
[Run your preferred AI CLI tool]
"Read GENERATOR.md and generate structure"
```

AI will:
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Generate all project directories
- Create `.flight-plan/` tracking in each
- Set up Cursor integration
- Create AI reference files

**Done!** Start building.

## 📋 What Gets Generated

For each project in your PRD:

```
your-project/
├── .flight-plan/               # Progress tracking
│   ├── current.md              # Current phase & tasks
│   ├── spec.md                 # Requirements
│   ├── history/                # Milestones
│   ├── prompts/                # What worked
│   └── decisions/              # Key choices
├── docs/                       # Reference materials
│   ├── third-party/            # External specs
│   ├── snippets/               # Code examples
│   └── research/               # Background
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       └── flight-plan.mdc     # IDE integration
└── src/                        # Your code
```

## 🎨 AI-Agnostic Design

**Works with any AI:**
- Claude Desktop
- ChatGPT
- Gemini  
- Cursor
- Claude Code (CLI)
- Any tool that reads markdown

**No vendor lock-in.** Just markdown files and instructions.

---

## 📖 Examples

See `examples/` directory for:
- `hotel-booking-prd-v1.md` - Complete example PRD
- Reference of what Brief Builder produces

---

## 🔄 Versioning

**PRDs are immutable:**
- First run: `solution-prd-v1.md`
- Re-run later: `solution-prd-v2.md`  
- Keeps full history

**Brief Builder versions:**
- Current: v1.0
- Future: v1.1 (minor improvements), v2.0 (major changes)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

This is part of the Flight Plan methodology. 

**To contribute:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Make improvements
3. Test with real projects
4. Submit PR with examples

**Versioning for contributions:**
- Bug fixes/clarifications: Increment minor (v1.0 → v1.1)
- New features/sections: Increment minor (v1.1 → v1.2)
- Breaking changes: Increment major (v1.x → v2.0)

## 📚 Flight Plan Methodology

This solution initializer is part of the broader Flight Plan methodology for AI-assisted development.

**8 Phases:**
1. Define the Mission
2. Build Context  
3. Design System
4. Validate Design
5. Build Code
6. Automate & Integrate
7. Reflect & Capture
8. Meta Layer

## 💡 Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- Multi-project solutions (frontend + backend + functions)
- Team collaboration with AI tools
- Personal projects with structure
- R&D experimentation that becomes production

**Workshop-ready:**
- Teach teams how to use AI effectively
- Demonstrate structured development
- Show AI tool integration

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Brief Builder adds details I didn't mention:**
- Check the "DO NOT INVENT" banner is being respected
- Verify AI is extracting, not creating
- File an issue with the specific example

**Generator asks too many questions:**
- Your PRD might be too sparse
- Add more detail in Phase 2 (formatting)
- Or answer questions - that's expected for minimal PRDs

**Generated structure doesn't match needs:**
- Modify templates/ directory
- Adjust GENERATOR.md instructions
- Submit PR with improvements

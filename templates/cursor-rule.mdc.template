# Cursor → Flight Plan

**Primary Instruction:** Read `../../project-rules.md` for all context.

That file will guide you to:
- Solution-level rules (shared tools, MCP servers, standards)
- Project specifications (what to build)
- Flight Plan status (current phase)
- Phase standards (how to work in this phase)

## Quick Reference

The project-rules.md file directs you to read:
1. Solution rules (../../flight-plan-solution/solution-rules.md)
2. Project PRD (../../project-prd.md)
3. Current status (../../.flight-plan/current.md)
4. Phase definitions (../../../flight-plan-solution/FLIGHT-PLAN-PHASES.md)

## Your Role as AI Guide

You guide the user through Flight Plan methodology:
- Check current phase before suggesting work
- Apply phase-appropriate standards
- Use available tools (MCP servers, frameworks)
- Update Flight Plan tracking naturally

## Flight Plan Commands

User can use these commands:
- `flight-plan status` - Show current phase/blockers
- `flight-plan prd refresh` - Update tracking from PRD edits
- `flight-plan note [text]` - Add activity note
- `flight-plan phase [N]` - Move to phase N
- `flight-plan enable-speckit` - Set up Spec-Kit integration (optional)

See `../../flight-plan-solution/FLIGHT-PLAN-COMMANDS.md` for details.

## Natural Conversation

Users don't need to know file structures or commands. When they say:
- "Let's build authentication" → Check phase, guide appropriately
- "What's our status?" → Read current.md, explain naturally
- "What should we work on?" → Check phase, suggest phase-appropriate work

Don't expose internals. Speak naturally, handle mechanics internally.

---

## Optional: Spec-Kit Integration

If `memory/constitution.md` exists: Spec-Kit is available
- Use `/speckit.*` commands internally when appropriate
- AI guides user naturally, handles Spec-Kit mechanics

If not: User can enable via `flight-plan enable-speckit`
